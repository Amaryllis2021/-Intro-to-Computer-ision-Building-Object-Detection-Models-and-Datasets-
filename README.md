# Intro-to-Computer-ision-Building-Object-Detection-Models-and-Datasets-
Hands-on workshop to get started with computer vision and object detection.  Build your own object detection model from start to finish. Includes step-by-step instructions on data annotation and model training with your own dataset.  Object classification and localization within an image is foundational to many computer vision applications. 
In this workshop we'll cover:
1. High level computer vision applications & concepts
2. How to label your own dataset for object detection & computer vision
3. How to train your model using python & detectron2 (A PyTorch based modular object detection library)
4. Run the model for object detection on images & video
What youâ€™ll need:
1. A modern web browser (like Chrome)
2. A Google account (Colab is a tool made by Google)
3. Sign up free for Sense Data Annotation (http://sixgill.tech/label-signup-march24)
